    <h3>Paperwork</h3>
    <p>
      Guests will need to have valid passports to enter Colombia, which can take
      ~3 months to get in the US. Some airlines require that your passport be
      valid at least 6 months beyond the dates of your trip. Guests from other
      countries might need a visa, so please check on this ASAP! In addition to
      a valid passport, you will need to fill out Colombia's version of a

        health declaration form

      There are no longer any requirements around COVID vaccinations or testing,
      but we'll keep this website updated if anything changes.

    <h3>Flights</h3>
    <p>
      Cartagena's airport is the Rafael Núñez International airport (airport
      code: CTG). You can find direct flights depending on where you're coming
      from, but a lot of them will involve a layover in Miami or a bigger
      Colombian city like Medellín or Bogotá.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spirit Airlines typically has the cheapest flights there. Their flights
      are usually only available about 6 months ahead of departure.
    </p>
    <h3>Transportation</h3>
    <p>
      Once you land in Cartagena, transport to the old city (highlighted below) is quick. The
      easiest way will be to take a taxi from the airport, which will run you
      about 15,000 - 20,000 Colombian Pesos (~$5). The old city itself is very
      small and walkable so no need to rent a car.

    <h3>Hotels</h3>
    <p>
      There are lots of hotel options in the old city, which is only about a 15
      minute walk from end to end. The venue is pretty centrally located, so
      you'll never be too far. Here are some recommendations:
