    <h4>Modern Love</h4>
    <p>
      Logan moved from Ohio into Margaret's apartment in Boston! Lucky for us,
      our third roommate, Michael, found Logan on Reddit. We were roommates for
      6 months, and it didn't take long for there to be a connection (at which
      point Margaret promptly told Logan he had to move out so we could date).

    <h4>Fun in the Sun (and Snow)</h4>
    <p>
      Both of us love sports and the outdoors, so it's always been a big part of
      our relationship. Logan knew he met his match when Margaret bested him in
      soccer volleyball soon after we met. Logan joined and made a big impact on
      our <strong>league-winning</strong> soccer team ("The Soccer Team"), which
      we still play together on, five years later. Margaret showed her commitment
      to Logan by slogging through many a bunny hill to share her ski knowledge with
      a boy from Ohio. We knew we were a good match when we consistently picked out
      overly-intense hikes to do together whenever we got the chance.

    <h4>Ausl√§nder</h4>
    <p>
      Another shared passion of ours is traveling, and in 2021 we got the
      opportunity to live in Cologne, Germany for a year as part of Margaret's
      PhD program. It was an amazing chance to travel all over Europe, to learn
      German (only Logan), and experience life through a new lens together. The
      lessons we learned from moving to a new country together during the
      pandemic helped build a strong foundation for our relationship.

    <h4>The Proposal</h4>
    <p>
      On a sunny April day, we took a walk to the Arboretum. Logan knew Margaret
      would love any chance to hang out with some trees. There was a spot
      amongst the pines picked out with our friends Emma and Freddy waiting in
      the bushes to take pictures. We both blacked out, but she said yes, and we
      got to celebrate at night over pisco sours with a bunch of our closest
      friends, and the rest is history!
