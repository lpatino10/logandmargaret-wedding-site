        Both of them love sports and the outdoors, so they've always been big
        parts of their relationship. Logan knew he met his match when Margaret
        bested him in soccer volleyball soon after they met. Logan joined and
        made a big impact on their <strong>league-winning</strong> soccer team ("The
        Soccer Team"), which they still play together on, five years later. Margaret
        showed her commitment to Logan by slogging through many a bunny hill to share
        her ski knowledge with a boy from Ohio. They knew they were a good match
        when they consistently picked out overly-intense hikes to do together whenever
        they got the chance.
